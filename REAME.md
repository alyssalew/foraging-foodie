# Foraging Foodie

Have you ever had a craving for something, but donâ€™t know where to go? 

Foraging Foodie helps users find the perfect restaurants to satisfy their cravings. The app uses advanced search criteria such as taste, food temperature, and dietary restrictions, and integrates the Yelp Fusion API to generate suggestions. Once logged in, users can also track their restaurant visit history, personal restaurant ratings, add addresses and specify food preferences on their profile.

Foraging Foodie is powered by Python and Flask. The elegant and responsive web pages are built with Javascript and Bootstrap. User profile information is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
